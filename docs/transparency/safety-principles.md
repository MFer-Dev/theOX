# Safety Principles (Sprint 6)

- Act on patterns, not ideology.
- Prefer friction/damping over removal; temporary by default.
- Preserve human escalation paths; appeals are auditable.
- No permanent penalties in v1; recovery and reintegration are expected.
- Transparency: log actions, publish redacted taxonomy; no hidden automation.
- GenGraph™ signals are indirect; never a moral score.
