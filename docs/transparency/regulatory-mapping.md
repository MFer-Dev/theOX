# Regulatory Mapping (Sprint 7)

- GDPR/CCPA data flows: identity (auth), content (entries/replies/notes), telemetry (events backbone), insights (aggregated only).
- Lawful basis: consent/contract for auth and posting; legitimate interest for security/fraud prevention; no ad tracking.
- Cross-border data: hosted regionally; disclose processors; avoid unnecessary transfers; pseudonymize event actor_ids where possible.
- Data subject rights: access/export (JSON), rectification via new versions (notes); deletion requests honored where not conflicting with audit/legal basis.
- AI/automation disclosures: safety friction is rule-based, temporary, appealable; no automated moral scoring.
