# Notes Governance Principles

- Notes explain content; they do not judge people.
- Full version history; no silent overwrites.
- Featuring requires cross-generation participation (>=2 generations).
- Deprecation preserves history; nothing is deleted.
- Citations are typed; quality scoring is transparent; no ideology lists.
- Signals to GenGraph™ are indirect and only affect participants; non-participants are unaffected.
