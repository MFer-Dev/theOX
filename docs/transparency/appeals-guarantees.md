# Appeals Guarantees

- Every appeal is accepted, logged, and receives a resolution.
- No silent drop: status is visible to ops; decisions include reason codes.
- Appeals do not worsen trust; recovery signals are emitted on resolution.
- Human escalation remains available for edge cases.
- Status visibility: appeals status exposed to ops and requesters; no silent closure.
