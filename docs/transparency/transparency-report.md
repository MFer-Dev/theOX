# Transparency Report v2 Template (Sprint 7)

Purpose: Explain how the system works in human-readable terms without leaking proprietary internals.

Sections:
- GenGraph™ overview (non-technical): generational credibility topology, event-driven, no single score.
- Community Notes: content-centric context, citations, versioned history, non-authoritative.
- Safety friction: pattern-based damping (cooldowns, weight reduction), temporary, reversible.
- Event taxonomy (redacted): categories for identity, discourse, endorse, cred, purge, safety, notes, trustgraph; fields are event_id, type, occurred_at, actor_id, actor_generation, correlation_id, payload; public, aggregated only.
- Aggregates: safety actions, appeals outcomes, purge impact, topic volatility snapshots, consensus/ contention heatmaps.
- Governance posture: human escalation preserved, appeals recorded, audit trails retained.
