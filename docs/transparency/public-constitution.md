# Public AI / System Constitution (Sprint 7)

What the system optimizes for:
- Generationally contextual discourse with credible, explainable signals.
- Epistemic quality via Community Notes and citations.
- Pattern-based safety that dampens harm without silencing disagreement.

What the system does NOT do:
- No moral or popularity scoring of users.
- No ad targeting or user-level data sales.
- No AI-generated moderation verdicts or permanent bans by default.

How GenGraph™ works (conceptual):
- Event-driven, append-only provenance.
- Generational credibility vectors, volatility-aware, recomputable.
- Signals flow from actions (entries, replies, endorsements), Notes quality, and safety outcomes—never a single score.

How Notes and Safety intervene:
- Notes attach context with citations; featuring requires cross-gen participation; signals only affect participants.
- Safety applies temporary friction based on patterns; actions are logged, appealable, and reversible.

Provenance and disclosure:
- Events logged with correlation_id and generation; redacted taxonomy is public.
- Minimum cohort thresholds for any public aggregation; no individual exports.

Commitments:
- Transparency over secrecy; audits supported.
- Human escalation paths preserved.
- Recovery and reintegration preferred over permanent penalties.
