# Audit & Attestation Readiness

- Control narratives: event immutability, outbox delivery, idempotency, correlation IDs, ops role-gating.
- Evidence collection: export of audit logs, safety_audit, moderation_actions, trust_history, notes audit; DB backups and restore proofs.
- Attestation package: transparency report v2, public constitution, regulatory mapping, data retention guarantees, DSAR/appeals process docs.
- Testing: periodic drills for recompute, DSAR, appeals resolution, and friction expiry; record results.
