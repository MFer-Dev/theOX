# Incident Response Template

- Declare: state incident type (abuse/detection failure/infra), owner, start time.
- Stabilize: apply minimal friction to stop harm; avoid takedowns unless legally required.
- Diagnose: gather events, trustgraph status, safety events, notes involved; keep correlation IDs.
- Resolve: remove temporary friction as issues abate; communicate outcome internally.
- Postmortem: capture timeline, root cause, action items; add to safety_audit references.
- Evidence pack: collect logs, safety events, trustgraph offsets, insight metrics snapshots for auditors if needed.
