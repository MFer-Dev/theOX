# Safety Ops Playbook

- Detect: monitor safety events, trustgraph volatility, and friction list.
- Act: apply friction types (reply cooldown, endorse weight reduction, cred throttle) via safety endpoints.
- Escalate: when automation is insufficient, route to human review; log decisions with reason codes.
- Resolve: let friction expire or resolve appeals; emit safety.resolved; update audit log.
- Communicate: keep correlation IDs; use transparency report language; avoid punitive tone.
