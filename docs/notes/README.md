# Notes Lifecycle & Signals (Sprint 4)

- Draft: editable by authors; not surfaced.
- Visible: visible inline but not highlighted or weighted.
- Featured: requires cross-generation participation (>=2 generations) and audit logging.
- Deprecated: preserved with full history; never deleted.
- Audit: feature/deprecation audit logs are mandatory; no silent state changes.

GenGraph™ signal invariant:
- Notes never affect credibility of users who did not participate in the note.

Purpose:
- Attach durable, explainable context with citations.
- Feed epistemic quality to GenGraph™ indirectly (via participating actors only).
