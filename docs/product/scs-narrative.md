# SCS Narrative Immunity (Sprint 23)

Core narrative (team-wide, locked)
> “Trybl replaces likes and views with a credibility signal based on conversation quality. It does not judge beliefs, morality, or worth — only how people participate here.”

Anticipated misframings & responses
- “This is a social credit system like China.”
  - No ranks. No classes. No privileges beyond content distribution. Scope is limited to Trybl participation.
- “You’re silencing dissent.”
  - Disagreement is rewarded when it continues conversation. Only low-signal or abusive behavior is dampened.
- “AI detection is censorship.”
  - AI use is allowed. Disclosure preserves trust. Undisclosed automation reduces credibility (SCS dampening via TW), not speech.

Product copy alignment
- Eligibility: “You’ve earned access.”
- Enforcement: surface reason codes only; never say “penalty”; frame as participation effects.
- No “low score” wording. No percentiles, ranks, trend arrows.

Press/partner safe summary (internal)
> “Trybl is organized by generations. Inside your Trybe, credibility grows through real conversation. Periodically, everyone comes together during The Gathering. We don’t use likes or rankings — instead we surface conversations that earn engagement from credible participants.”

Non-goals
- No new score types, no gamification, no monetization, no public dashboards, no analytics surfaces.
