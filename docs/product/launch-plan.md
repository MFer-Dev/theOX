# Launch Sequencing & Trybe Seeding (Sprint 25)

Strategy (locked)
- Do not launch to everyone at once; early culture > raw growth.

Trybe launch order (recommended)
1) Gen X (conversational, less performative)
2) Millennials (reflective, high participation)
3) Gen Z (high energy, after norms exist)
- Boomers/Gen Alpha follow later with adjusted onboarding.

Seeding criteria
- Favor: people comfortable with disagreement; low-influencer-density users; writers/teachers/builders/parents.
- Avoid: influencer-heavy cohorts; activist brigades; meme-first communities.

Early visibility rules (temporary)
- Overweight reply depth, sustained discussion, cross-topic curiosity.
- De-emphasize reaction-only content to lock norms.

Gathering scale guidance
- ≤1k: intimate; threads readable end-to-end.
- ≤100k: sorting emphasizes credible participation; duplicate topics cluster naturally.
- 1M+: stronger dampening on repetitive replies; increased TW sensitivity; visibility decay for flame-war threads.

Transition moment (aligned with existing Gathering end)
- When Gathering ends: UI collapses/fades; return to Trybe with the one-time transition within 24h; no replay; quiet return otherwise.

Non-goals
- No paid verification, no growth hacking, no influencer programs, no monetization surfaces, no user analytics dashboards.
