# SCS Norms, Culture & Adversarial Hardening (Sprint 21)

## Core principles
- Norms are learned by observation, not rules.
- Enforcement is quiet and boring; abuse feels ineffective.
- Credibility comes from conversation quality, not opinion alignment.
- If users talk more about the score than with each other, we failed.

## Norm formation
- Trybe feed favors posts with sustained reply depth and credible repliers; reaction-only posts are visually downplayed; SCS badge is muted.
- Compose nudges: open-ended placeholder (“What’s your take? Invite others to respond.”) and a gentle “Take a moment” hint after rapid posting; no hard warnings.
- Replies: one-word/emoji replies render smaller/muted; continuation is implicitly favored.
- New users: see others’ SCS; their own starts neutral and moves slowly; no “low score” callouts.
- Avoid obsession: no comparisons, deltas, streaks, or percentiles; SCS is a reputation signal, not progress.

## Adversarial scenarios (expected) and mitigations
- Troll amplification: reply storms from low-TW actors move SCS minimally; upheld reports dampen post SCS.
- Ideological brigading: correlated low-TW bursts are dampened; visibility throttles automatically; brigades exhaust without credibility.
- AI content farms: stylometry/timing/repetition reduce TW; undisclosed AI dampens SCS deltas; repetition penalties across accounts.
- Political capture narrative: no leaderboards, no punish-by-opinion; transparent reason codes; appeals + rehab; SCS scoped to content integrity, not morality.

## Failure modes & recovery
- False positives: appeal path required; recovery over time guaranteed; no permanent damage without repeated upheld outcomes.
- Over-cautious users (reply depth drops): tuning lever—relax dampening, increase weight of first-order replies (not a UX change).

## Eligibility (Gathering) tie-in
- Eligibility earned via SCS delta in Trybe or qualifying actions (post/reply/active read). Copy: “You’ve earned access.”

## Calibration hooks (from Sprint 22)
- Early/late SCS velocity: slow early movement; sensitivity increases with sustained participation; single events cannot spike/crater.
- Diminishing returns: volume dampening and reply-depth caps; long flame-wars decay faster; small steady threads still count.
- Recovery: penalties are bounded; time/behavior-based rehabilitation; appeals restore over time; no silent bias accumulation.

## Enforcement transparency
- Warnings/restrictions surface reason codes; appeals are rate-limited; non-severe cases can rehabilitate (SCS can rebound over time).

## What we do not add
- No new score types, monetization, verification tiers, power-user privileges, or public moderation actions; no leaderboards or streaks.
