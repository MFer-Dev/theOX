# Onboarding & Generational Context

- First-run flow: recap generation verification, why Trybes exist, and The Gathering overview.
- Explain boundaries simply: “You mostly see your Trybe; The Gathering temporarily opens all Trybes.”
- Show Gathering indicator and countdown in UI; no policy-heavy language.
- Add friction notifications: when cooldowns or weight reductions apply, show a descriptive banner linking to explanation.
- Keep copy concise; link to transparency report for deeper reading.
