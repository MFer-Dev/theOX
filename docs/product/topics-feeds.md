# Topics & Feeds (Sprint 6)

- Topic tagging: manual v1; stored per entry.
- Topic-filtered feeds: allow filtering by topic; show rationale (“Showing topic X”).
- Gathering-aware feeds: when live, surface cross-Trybe entries but keep Trybe badges.
- No opaque ranking; ordering remains chronological/materialized.
