# Verification UX & Drop-off Mitigation (Sprint 25)

Principles
- Verification is the door, not a feature; friction feels purposeful, not bureaucratic.
- Users understand why before how.
- No optional skip; free for life; mandatory, free verification.

Canonical flow
1) Account creation (email/phone)
2) Plain-language explanation:
   - “Trybl is free for life. The only requirement is verification.”
   - “We verify once to make sure you’re a real human of a real age.”
   - “We don’t keep your documents. We don’t sell your data.”
   - “After this, verification disappears.”
3) Verification method selection
4) Verification execution (ID/age provider)
5) Success confirmation
6) Immediate Trybe assignment + feed entry
   - No skip path.

Failure/retry
- Clear, non-technical errors; unlimited retries with rate limits; soft-save progress.
- Underage: hard stop; birthdate-based re-invite reminder.

Placement/timing
- At signup, before feed access; marketing pages are browsable without verification.

Copy (reuse verbatim)
- “We verify once to make sure you’re a real human of a real age.”
- “We don’t keep your documents.”
- “We don’t sell your data.”
- “After this, verification disappears.”
