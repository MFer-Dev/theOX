# Cursor UI Prompting Rules

- Use the app’s **Tamagui-based UI layer only** (prefer `apps/mobile/src/ui` primitives + recipes; avoid importing Tamagui directly from screens).
- Follow **standard mobile app layouts** (tabs, stacks, sheets, modals, lists).
- Reference **premium UI kits (e.g., Untitled UI)** for inspiration only.
- Do **not** invent new layout paradigms unless required by Trybe gating, Gathering state, or cred/endorsement mechanics.
- Favor clarity over cleverness.
- The Gathering (mapped to the existing purge state) is the only approved reason to visually diverge from standard app patterns. Any UI deviation must be justified as Gathering state signaling.
